# Lab: Blind SQL injection with out-of-band interaction

## Lab's description

This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

**End goal:** exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator.

# Lab: Blind SQL injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

## Lab's description

This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.

**End goal:** log in as the administrator user.
